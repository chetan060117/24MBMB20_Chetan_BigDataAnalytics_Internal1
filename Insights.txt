1.Averagedeliverytimeperrestaurant

Massive Performance Disparity: There is a significant variation in delivery times.

Worst Performer: Restaurant R3 is a major problem, with an average delivery time of over 90 minutes. This is likely unacceptable for most customers.

Other Slow Restaurants: R2, R5, R9, and R8 also have long delivery times, ranging from 70 to 80 minutes.

Best Performer: Restaurant R7 is the fastest, with an average time of approximately 45 minutes. R10 is also relatively efficient at around 55-60 minutes.

2.Totalordervaluepercustomer and Customer_cancellations

Identification of High-Value Customers (HVCs):

Customers C5 (total value ~420) and C15 (total value ~400) are your most valuable customers by a significant margin. They contribute a large portion of the revenue.

Identification of At-Risk/Dissatisfied Customers:

Customer C7 has the lowest order value (around 20) and is the only customer who has cancelled orders (2 cancellations).


The combination of very low order value and multiple cancellations strongly suggests that C7 is a churned or churning customer. They likely had a very poor initial experience, cancelled their orders, and have not returned. This is a critical failure in the customer journey.

3.PeakorderHours:
The demand pattern is very clear with two main peaks:

Lunch Rush: A sharp peak around 12:00 PM (hour 12).

Dinner Rush: Another, slightly higher peak around 6:00 PM (hour 18).

There is also a smaller, late-night spike around 11:00 PM (hour 23).

Off-Peak Lulls: The quietest period is the mid-afternoon, specifically around 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM (hours 14-15).
